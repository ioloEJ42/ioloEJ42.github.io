  "appearance-notes": "<p>Tharion has pale skin with a slight bluish tint, typical of some high elves. His hair is silver with streaks of dark blue, usually kept in a loose ponytail. His eyes are a striking violet, and they seem to glow faintly when he casts spells.</p><p>He stands 6'1\" tall with a slender build. He typically wears practical robes in deep blue colors with silver embroidery depicting arcane symbols. His hands bear small burn scars from early experiments with evocation magic.</p><p>Tharion carries an ornate quarterstaff made of dark wood with silver inlays, which doubles as his walking stick. A crystal orb hangs at his belt, which he uses as his arcane focus.</p>",

  "background-content": "<p>Tharion was born to a family of scholars in the elven city of Silvergrove. From an early age, he showed a remarkable aptitude for magic, particularly evocation spells.</p><p>He spent decades studying in the great libraries of his homeland before setting out to explore the world. His insatiable curiosity about the nature of magical energy led him to travel extensively, documenting various magical phenomena and collecting rare arcane texts.</p><p>Five years ago, Tharion narrowly escaped a catastrophic magical accident caused by an inexperienced apprentice at an arcane academy. The incident left several wizards dead and convinced Tharion that proper magical education was essential. Since then, he has dedicated himself to collecting dangerous magical knowledge to ensure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.</p><p>Recently, rumors of an ancient evocation grimoire have drawn him to the frontier lands, where he now seeks companions to help him in his search.</p>",

  "personality-content": "<p>Tharion is methodical, precise, and sometimes painfully literal. He approaches problems with logic and reason, often failing to understand emotional responses.</p><p>He has little patience for those who misuse magic or fail to respect its power. Despite his serious demeanor, he has a dry wit that occasionally surfaces in moments of calm.</p><p>Tharion values knowledge above all else and will go to great lengths to preserve rare books or magical artifacts, sometimes at risk to himself or others.</p>",

  "ideals-content": "<p>Knowledge should be preserved and protected, but dangerous secrets must be kept from those who would misuse them.</p><p>Magic is neither good nor evil - it is a tool whose nature depends entirely on the wielder.</p><p>The greatest responsibility of the powerful is to use their power wisely.</p>",

  "bonds-content": "<p>I will recover the lost arcane texts of the Silvergrove Library, scattered during the Great Scattering.</p><p>The professor who taught me evocation magic was killed by his own spell. I seek to perfect the spell he was working on to honor his memory.</p><p>I owe a debt to the family that sheltered me after the arcane accident, and I send them gold whenever I can.</p>",

  "flaws-content": "<p>I sometimes become so focused on magical theory that I lose track of immediate dangers.</p><p>I'm dismissive of those who don't understand or appreciate magic.</p><p>I have an intense fear of magical fires getting out of control due to past trauma.</p><p>I struggle to keep secrets when the knowledge could advance magical understanding.</p>"
