  "content": "<p>A clean, efficient browser homepage I built to replace the default new tab page. Designed with speed and simplicity in mind while including the features I personally needed.</p><h2>Features</h2><ul><li>Multi-engine search functionality (DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing)</li><li>Organized link categories for quick access to frequently used sites</li><li>Real-time clock display</li><li>Built-in reference sheets for Linux commands (i3WM, tmux, nano)</li><li>Minimal design with dot grid background</li></ul><h2>Why I Built It</h2><p>I created this dashboard to have complete control over my browsing experience. My motivations included:</p><ul><li>Having quick access to Linux documentation and resources</li><li>Creating an easily accessible reference for command shortcuts</li><li>Implementing a cleaner, darker aesthetic I prefer</li><li>Building something lightweight with zero dependencies</li><li>Having full ownership of the code rather than relying on extensions</li></ul><h2>Implementation</h2><p>Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no frameworks, no build tools, no overhead. The entire dashboard loads instantly and runs entirely in the browser.</p>"
